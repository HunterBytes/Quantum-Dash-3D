The issue you're encountering is related to the Markdown formatting of the headings and the links in the Table of Contents. For the links in the Table of Contents to work properly, the heading text and the links must match the expected format exactly.

Correcting the Links in the Table of Contents
Ensure that each section title in the Table of Contents links to the corresponding section header in the document.

The format for a heading link should match the section title, converted to lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens, and any special characters (like commas) removed.

Here's the corrected version of your README.md:

### Explanation:
- The section headers in the `Table of Contents` (`[Introduction](#introduction)`, `[Project Structure](#project-structure)`, `[Installation](#installation)`, etc.) must match the actual headers exactly.
- The headers in the `README.md` use `##` for subheadings, making them the correct anchor links (`#introduction`, `#project-structure`, etc.).
- If the links still don’t work, make sure there are no invisible characters or case mismatches in the header text.

Try updating your `README.md` file with this structure and check if the links work as expected. Let me know if you have further issues or need additional adjustments!
